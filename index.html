      const actionPlans = {
        1: `üî¥ Level 1: Deep Negativity

Goal:
Rebuild basic emotional and physical safety.

Action Plan:
1. Reconnect with the present:
   - Take 3 deep breaths. Name 5 objects around you.
   - Place your hand on your chest and say: "I am safe. This will pass."

2. Gentle body activation:
   - Stretch, move fingers, roll neck. Step outside if possible.

3. Warmth and support:
   - Message someone: "I'm struggling a bit right now."
   - Wrap in a blanket or hold a pillow. Feel safe.

4. Micro tasks:
   - Make your bed, wash your face, play calming music.
   - One tiny victory is enough.

5. Safe inner imagery:
   - Visualize a calm place. Let your body feel it for 30+ sec.

‚ö†Ô∏è Emotional Traps:
- Isolation: don't disappear ‚Äî message someone.
- Social comparison: avoid social media.
- Harsh self-talk: be kind, not forceful.
- Shame spirals: pain ‚â† brokenness.`,

        2: `üü† Level 2: Heavy Experiences

Goal:
Gently reawaken emotional awareness and build quiet strength.

Action Plan:
1. Acknowledge your numbness:
   - It's okay to feel nothing. Don't force yourself to "be okay."
   - Say: "Even numbness is a signal. I am still here."

2. Gentle sensory input:
   - Light a candle, hold something warm, or take a bath.
   - Listen to soft instrumental music or nature sounds.

3. Emotional reentry:
   - Watch a moving video, look at meaningful photos.
   - Journal: "If I could feel anything right now, what might it be?"

4. Micro-movements:
   - Walk slowly. Stretch arms and shoulders. Lay in sunlight.
   - Allow stillness but not stagnation.

5. Symbolic acts:
   - Make tea. Light incense. Rearrange a corner of your room.
   - Small rituals can reconnect you with meaning.

‚ö†Ô∏è Emotional Traps:
- "Nothing matters" mindset ‚Äî challenge it gently.
- Over-sleeping or total shutdown ‚Äî allow rest, but add light structure.
- Pretending you're fine ‚Äî be honest with one person you trust.
- Substance numbing ‚Äî avoid alcohol or over-scrolling.`,

        3: `üü† Level 3: Negative Activation

Typical Emotional State:
Tense, restless, irritated, impulsive, scattered, hyper-activated but not focused.
You feel like you're doing something ‚Äî but not necessarily the right things.

Associated Emotions:
Frustration, Anxiety, Stress, Impatience, Overwhelm, Confusion, Agitation, Urgency

üîç Key Traits of This Level:
You're active ‚Äî but it's often reactive, not conscious or strategic.
Often triggered by a fear of falling behind, missing out, or being judged.
You might appear productive on the outside, but inside there's chaotic urgency.

‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls / Traps:
- Overreacting ‚Äî sending messages, quitting, or deciding things impulsively.
- Overcommitting ‚Äî saying yes to everything because of pressure or fear of missing out.
- Avoiding root causes ‚Äî staying "busy" to avoid uncomfortable introspection.
- Misinterpreting stress as motivation ‚Äî mistaking tension for momentum.
- Making rushed decisions ‚Äî buying things, launching too soon, miscommunicating.

‚úÖ Strategies to Move Up to Constructive Energy / Clarity:
1. Pause before reacting.
   Ask: "Am I responding to reality, or to fear?"

2. Rechannel the energy.
   Go for a short run, do breathwork, shake out the tension, or dance ‚Äî burn the static charge.

3. Practice the 3-Minute Mind Dump.
   Write every thought, to-do, and worry on paper. No filter. Just empty your mind.

4. Name the emotion honestly.
   "I'm not just busy, I'm overwhelmed and scared I'll fail." Naming is taming.

5. Reconnect with your values.
   Ask: "Is what I'm doing aligned with what actually matters to me?"

6. Focus on a single priority.
   Pick one small task. Complete it slowly, mindfully. Feel the shift.

‚ö° Power-Up Move:
Do 30 seconds of "Box Breathing":
Inhale 4s ‚Üí Hold 4s ‚Üí Exhale 4s ‚Üí Hold 4s. Repeat 4 times.
This activates the parasympathetic nervous system, reducing impulsivity and improving clarity.`,

        4: `üü° Level 4: Stabilization & Neutral

Typical Emotional State:
Balanced, calm, indifferent, grounded, "okay."
You're no longer reactive ‚Äî but not yet inspired or energized either.
A crucial pivot point in the emotional ladder.

üå§Ô∏è Associated Emotions:
Neutral, Stable, Content, Accepting, Mild interest, Calm, Open, Reflective, Centered

‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls / Hidden Traps:
- Staying too long in "neutral gear" ‚Äî comfortable but stagnant.
- Mistaking stability for progress ‚Äî no real movement forward.
- Emotional numbness ‚Äî confusing peace with disconnection.
- Avoiding ambition ‚Äî rejecting desire to avoid risk.
- Procrastination disguised as presence ‚Äî "I'm just going with the flow" without direction.

‚úÖ Strategies to Move Up into Engagement & Positive Momentum:
1. Reconnect with curiosity.
   Ask: "What could be interesting right now?" or "What would feel satisfying to create or explore?"

2. Do a 5-minute "momentum builder" task.
   Small win that gives a sense of progress: clean a drawer, send one email, sketch one idea.

3. Visualize best-case future.
   Use the "3 Months From Now" prompt:
   "If I felt proud and aligned 3 months from now‚Ä¶ what would I be doing today?"

4. Choose one low-stakes creative action.
   Draw. Write freely. Reorganize your space. Make a playlist. Create without pressure.

5. Ground your body.
   Light stretching, walking barefoot, tai chi, breath-led yoga ‚Äî builds presence and energy.

‚ö° Power-Up Move:
Do the "Energy Check-In":
- Body: How do I feel physically?
- Mind: What's the loudest thought?
- Emotion: What's the background emotion?
- Soul: What do I quietly desire?

This creates internal coherence and readiness for flow.`,

        5: `üü° Level 5: Willingness / Hope / Mild Positivity

Typical Emotional State:
You're open. Curious. Ready to engage.
Not quite inspired, but no longer stuck ‚Äî this is the beginning of upward momentum.

üåü Associated Emotions:
Hopeful, Optimistic, Interested, Willing, Curious, Open-minded, Encouraged, Eager (mildly), Motivated (starting to emerge)

‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls / Hidden Traps:
- Overestimating readiness ‚Äî taking on too much too fast can overwhelm this delicate stage.
- Lack of clear direction ‚Äî momentum without aim leads to scattered effort.
- Relying too much on external validation ‚Äî still not fully rooted in intrinsic drive.
- Avoiding deeper internal work ‚Äî trying to "stay positive" without resolving lingering issues.

‚úÖ Strategies to Move Up into True Positivity & Flow:
1. Set small, clear intentions.
   Not massive goals ‚Äî just a next step with meaning (e.g. "Reach out to one person I admire").

2. Track micro-wins.
   Each small success builds confidence and reinforces upward movement. Try journaling "3 wins a day."

3. Practice emotional momentum.
   Notice and extend moments when you feel uplifted (amplify instead of dismissing them).

4. Connect with purpose, not pressure.
   Ask: "Why does this matter to me personally?" Focus on contribution and meaning.

5. Use movement to shift energy.
   Dance, walk with intention, tidy your space with music ‚Äî use your body to support forward emotion.

6. Surround yourself with inspiration.
   Podcasts, people, quotes ‚Äî everything around you should reinforce upward direction.

‚ö° Power-Up Move:
Do a "Courage Ritual" ‚Äî
Commit to one thing today that's slightly uncomfortable but aligned with growth (send a pitch, ask a question, apply to something).
This builds emotional muscle and trust in yourself.

üß≠ Reframe for Growth:
Willingness is the bridge between neutrality and creativity.
It's where real personal transformation begins ‚Äî not in massive breakthroughs, but in small consistent actions.
This is where the Flow state starts to become possible ‚Äî as your energy and trust return.`,

        6: `üü° Level 6: Contentment / Calm Joy / Satisfaction

üåø Typical Emotional State:
You feel good ‚Äî not ecstatic, but grounded and genuinely okay.
There's a sense of peace, lightness, and presence. You're not rushing, not grasping ‚Äî and that's powerful.

üåü Associated Emotions:
Calm, Relaxed, Satisfied, Grateful, Light-hearted, Present, Balanced, Comfortable, Steady, Appreciative

‚úÖ Strategies to Move Up into Enthusiasm, Passion & Flow:
1. Tune into gratitude.
   Identify 3 small things that bring you peace right now (e.g., sunlight, coffee aroma, a finished task).

2. Create from stillness.
   This is a great place to write, plan, or make art ‚Äî without pressure.

3. Simplify.
   Let go of tasks or ideas that clutter your mind. Focus on what matters most today.

4. Go deeper with presence.
   Practice mindfulness. Slow meals, mindful walks, gentle meditation. These amplify contentment.

5. Share light energy.
   A simple compliment, a smile, or helping hand deepens your own experience of well-being.

6. Do small acts of alignment.
   Tidy a corner, stretch your back, drink water. Harmony in small actions reinforces this stable energy.

‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls / Hidden Traps:
- Complacency: Staying in contentment too long can cause stagnation or missed growth opportunities.
- Fear of shaking peace: Avoiding challenges because they may disturb your balance (which can block progress).
- Underestimating your potential: Settling for "okay" when you're ready for "amazing."

üî• Power-Up Move:
Ask: "What would my calmest, wisest self gently stretch into right now?"
Then do that. Keep it light, but directed.

üß≠ Reframe for Growth:
Contentment is a powerful launchpad.
From here, you can build sustainable momentum toward creative energy, passion, and purpose ‚Äî without burning out.
Enjoy it ‚Äî but don't settle if your soul is calling for more.`,

        7: `üü° Level 7: Optimism / Curiosity / Interest

üåü Typical Emotional State:
This level is your turning point. You begin to look toward the future with hope.
Your mind starts generating ideas, asking questions, wanting to move toward something.

üí¨ Associated Emotions:
Curious, Interested, Hopeful, Optimistic, Open-minded, Playful, Engaged, Alert, Energetic, Lightly Motivated

‚úÖ Strategies to Move Up into Enthusiasm & Inspired Action:
1. Follow the spark.
   Ask: "What feels interesting right now?" Then give it 15‚Äì30 minutes of focused attention.

2. Set a micro-goal.
   Not a big outcome. Just the next meaningful step ‚Äî clarity fuels momentum.

3. Brainstorm freely.
   Capture ideas without judging. Let imagination run before refining.

4. Change environments.
